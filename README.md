# boardgame-helpers
A collection of programs that automate some of the steps of some tabletop games

Most of these should be self-explanatory.  The Javascript programs can be
loaded into any web browser.  Enter any required data in the text fields
and press the button for results.  You may need to examine the source code
to understand what each script really does.

To run the script on your phone, just download the script and load it
in your phone's browser.  You can link directly to the file on github.com.

I would be happy to consider writing a script for your favorite board
game in exchange for a free copy of that game.
