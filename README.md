# boardgame-helpers
A collection of programs that automate some of the steps of some tabletop games

Most of these should be self-explanatory.  The Javascript programs can be
loaded into any web browser.  Enter any required data in the text fields
and press the button for results.  You may need to examine the source code
to understand what each script really does.

The easiest way to run these scripts is to use my web server:

You can also download them and run them locally from your phone or PC, but
that may not work for scripts that use cookies.  That is because some
browsers won't allow cookies to be set from web pages that were not served
from a real web site.

I would be happy to consider writing a script for your favorite board
game in exchange for a free copy of that game.
